# Advent of Code 2018
## Overview
My first AOC year but the code is lost to the sands of time.

Redo started November 2024

## Day 1
Warmup! Done in 5 minutes

Difficulty: 1/10

## Day 2
Warmup! Done in 5 minutes

Difficulty: 2/10

## Day 3
Bumping up a little bit - 10 minutes

Difficulty: 3/10

## Day 7
Custom topological sort! Now we're getting into it. 

REWRITE: 12/15/24

Difficulty: 5/10

## Day 8
Recursive tree parse / traversal. Fun one.

REWRITE: 12/30/24 from Thomas's nursery. One month!

Difficulty: 5/10

## Day 9 
Interval math! Edit: OK, not interval math, "do you know how to use a linked list".

Part 1 done in 20 minutes, just a few fiddly edge cases. 
Part 2 done in 20 minutes, use a deque!

REWRITE 12/30/24

Difficulty: 4/10

Lessons learned: Python lists are more like arrays, not like linked lists. Inserts and dels require full copies. Deque is much preferred for applications like many in AOC where you have lots of inserts/deletes at one spot.

## Day 11
Search for largest region over a crypto-y grid.

Part 1: Straightforward impl of puzzle as described.
Part 2: Realize that calculation can be done in O(1) time with an O(N^2) precomputation step. Initial impl was O(N^4)+.

Lesson learned: DEBUG USING SIMPLE EXAMPLES, build up from base components that are trusted!

## Day 12
Detect the period. Added a detect_steady_state function to the library to do this in an automated fashion in the future.

Difficulty: 4.5/10

## Day 13
Simulate mine carts! Fun but READ THE PROBLEM, HARVEY

Rewrite 12/31/2024

Difficulty: 5/10

## Day 14
Generate a large list of numbers. Feel like I lost the plot on this one and accidentally brute forced it.

Rewrite 12/31/2024

Difficulty: 5/10

## Day 15
Oh man, I remember this one... Simulate a dungeon with dozens of characters pathfinding, lots of fiddly little bits. 

Rewrite ~1/1/2024

Difficulty: 9/10

## Day 16
Cumsums - standard interview-ish problem. Fiddly to get the indices right, fun and fair.

Rewrite ~1/1/2024

Difficulty: 7/10

## Day 17
Fill the pools! Super fun!

Rewrite 1/2/24

Difficulty: 7/10

## Day 18
Find the period

Rewrite 1/2/24

Difficulty: 7/10

## Day 19
Figure out which ops were which! Super fun. 

Rewrite 1/3/24

Difficulty: 8/10

## Day 20
oooh, spicy. The "you can take these paths" to generate the maze problem.

Rewrite 1/3/24.

Difficulty: 9/10

## Day 21
Yessss a badass dissasembly problem. A war to figure out what the program is doing especially because of the whole "ip bound to register" thing obfuscating code.

Rewrite 1/3/2024

Difficulty: 9/10

## Day 22
Standard "navigate a grid" problem.

Rewrite 1/3/2024

Difficulty: 6/10

## Day 23
The octree problem! Segment a 3d space. 

Rewrite 1/4/2024

Difficulty: 9/10

## Day 24
OK some annoying parsing but other than that a straightforward sim. 

Rewrite 1/4/2024

Difficulty: 6/10

## Day 25
Powered through it in 5 minutes with NX. 

Rewrite 1/4/2024
