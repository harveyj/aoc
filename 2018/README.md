## Day 8
Recursive tree parse / traversal. Fun one.

REWRITE: 12/30/24 from Thomas's nursery. One month!

Difficulty: 5/10

## Day 9 
Interval math! Edit: OK, not interval math, "do you know how to use a linked list".

Part 1 done in 20 minutes, just a few fiddly edge cases. 
Part 2 done in 20 minutes, use a deque!

REWRITE 12/30/24

Difficulty: 4/10

Lessons learned: Python lists are more like arrays, not like linked lists. Inserts and dels require full copies. Deque is much preferred for applications like many in AOC where you have lots of inserts/deletes at one spot.
