Rewritten from scratch - really happy with my solution here, replaced a lot of total hacks and non-functioning code with an elegant solution that works by design.

REMAKE 12/19/24 in between Thomas feedings/screamings. Wearing festive socks and my Tree Rex shirt.

Difficulty: 9/10 (orig), 7/10 (redo)

## Day 20
Navigate an infinite-level maze.

Lessons learned:
- If the code claims it sucks, just go and rewrite it
- ALWAYS BEWARE SEMANTIC WHITESPACE
- If you change the base lib and don't think carefully about backwards compat, shame on you.
