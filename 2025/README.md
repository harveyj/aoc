# Advent of Code 2025
## Overview
Another pure Python year. Capen year 3!

Started 12/3/2025, finished ??.

## Day 1
Three minutes part 1! 12 minutes part 2

For part 2 my math-based solution had a subtle bug somewhere so I powered through and just did the counter in clicks of 1.

Difficulty: 1/10

Done 12/3/25 in between caring for sick Thomas. Did a little Mannheim while coding.

## Day 2
Some leading zero bugs derailed what would have otherwise been a super fast solution.

Difficulty: 3/10

Done 12/3/25 in between caring for sick Thomas. Did a little Mannheim while coding.
